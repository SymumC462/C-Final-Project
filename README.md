# C-Final-Project
Text-Based Adventure Game
Create a text-based game, in the style of Colossal Cave Adventure. You will need to create your own storyline, write text-based prompts for your user to navigate the game, and write an ending (or multiple endings) for your user's character.
This is a very open-ended project, but your code must include the following:
1)at least 15 functions that you write, outside of main
2)at least 2 classes, and multiple instances of creating objects of those classes
3)at least 1 game-within-a-game, where your user must play a game or complete a task using rand(), the psuedo-random number generator
4)at least 1 variable that changes with your user throughout the gameplay (for example: a score; an inventory of things they are holding; etc.) - and we should have the option to see an output of this score, inventory, etc.
5)at least 2 instances of ASCII art
6)at least 18 "locations," or decision/branch points, for your users to navigate *
*The game does not have to be as long as Colossal Cave Adventure (there are 140 map "locations" in that game, when the user gets a chance to make a decision!), but this game should be an involved, significant experience to build and to play; it should take us more than 5 minutes to get through the action. Stretch yourself - creativity and any added features here will be rewarded!
A few examples: your user is an astronaut exploring Mars, and she finds a locked safe in a crater and needs to crack the combination to open the safe as part of the mission; OR your user gets a new job counting rats in NYC subway tunnels, and needs to guess which train is coming first to avoid danger; OR your user is a student studying in the CCNY library, who finds a book with a note in it, which leads them to a party where they have to play Blackjack at the door in order to get in; OR your user is starting a garden, and they have to respond to random acts of weather by choosing the right tools and actions; OR your user is shipwrecked and they have to find their way home, including picking up items on an island and guessing a password in order to stow away on a pirate ship; etc. etc ... this is a chance to be creative and explore a story that you enjoy.

6- need an array that holds the area names, and we do smt if the array value is a certain area name

3-  have the player encounter a creature, make it a number guessing game, use rand to randomly select a number and have the player guess in a hot and cold selection

2- one class for items, another for 

4- either an inventory that holds items for progression, or special collectibles that add to a score for progression

5- can be used at any point to represent any image 

The premise could be a dungeon explorer, in a dungeon collecting loot and having to get all the loot in the dungeon to leave.
